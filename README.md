# Character Recognition-Neural Networks-Hebb
Character recognition Function using Hebbian Learning Algorithm with python

This program can classify O shape from X shape. to do this i used 5x5 matrix representing O or X.

For testing a new shape you can change the value of test1 variable in line 107.

this neural network trained by tiny data set named: dataset.txt
